# eBayuyer

## Quick start

This project is based on [ngbp](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp). To run it:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:Raidok/eBayuyer.git
$ cd eBayuyer
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower http-server
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/project/build/index.html` in your browser OR open another console, run `http-server build` and open `http://localhost:8080` in Your browser.

Unfortunately all the functions do not seem to work any more, seems like eBay has changed their API.
